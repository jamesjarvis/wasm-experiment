# WASM Experiment

This is just to see what this [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org) malarky is all about.

TODO:

- [ ] Get a basic Go WASM app working
- [ ] Transition most of the project to use [Please](https://please.build)
- [ ] Perhaps make a go -> wasm plz build def
- [ ] Reflect on why you are wasting your time doing this rather than doing something that actually makes money
